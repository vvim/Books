QT4.8 Demo Books, making it work for MySQL

This project is based on the demonstration code from QT 4.8 found at http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qt-demos-books-example.html .

Unfortunately, it only uses a database in memory, so this project is my attempt for making it work in MySQL .
I use a default MySQL server on my localhost, and gave it the dummy values:

	#define HOST "localhost"
	#define DATABASE "test"
	#define USER "testuser"
	#define PASSWORD "HiDrNick!"

Feel free to change it of course :-)
